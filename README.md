# (Working title) Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn): A toolbox for terrestrial biosphere modeling and analysis

This repository is for managing the PEcAn technical description paper in preparation for submission over the next few months.
In a nutshell, the paper will describe the major features of PEcAn and demonstrate them in action through a case study involving a single-site model intercomparison.
The target journal for this paper has not been decided yet, but will most likely be one of the following:

- Geoscientific Model Development
- Methods in Ecology and Evolution
- Journal of Advances in Modeling the Earth System
